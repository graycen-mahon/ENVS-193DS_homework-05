**METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION**

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:

For this study, the data was sampled by selected two plants of each of the Sarracenia species and they were then assigned to a specific "feeding level", ranked 1-6. The rankings coincided with the size of the plants, and were therefore given different amounts of feed. Over 7 weeks (on a once a week feeding schedule) the plants were measured for their size as well as photosynthetic rate both prior to and during the treatment.
